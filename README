PURPOSE

  Executable wrapper to fake the results of syscalls which return absolute
  times. Calls to SYS_gettimeofday, SYS_clock_gettime, and SYS_time are
  intercepted.

CAVEATS

  Will not work for all calls on kernels implementing vsyscalls, e.g. some
  x86_64. These cannot be intercepted since on such systems gettimeofday is not
  actually a syscall; glibc reads the time for a shared page which is updated
  by the kernel.

USAGE

  % timetravel <offset> <executable> <program args>

  where offset is a positive or negative time in seconds.
